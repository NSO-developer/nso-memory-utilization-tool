# NSO Memory Utilization Measurement Tool
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/NSO-developer/nso-memory-utilization-tool)  

This is a tool to plot live RSS(Physical Memory Utilization) and Memory Allocated for JavaVM, PythonVMs and NSO Core for NSO. The purpose of this tool is to gain a higher level overview on how memory usage developed during various of incident. Eventually help out Customer to understand what is actually happened in their environment, CX on troubleshooting and BU on understanding and fix the problem. 

## Dependency
Gnuplot
```
apt-get install gnuplot
```

## Usage
Start measurement and input measurement time period. The diagram will generated afterwards in the graphs folder per process after the data collection
```
sh plot.sh [--verbose|-v] <Time Duration>
```


## Data Collection Source
* The Memory Allocated is taking the value in "writeable/private" from pmap command.(Suggestion from Magnus Thoang from Architect Support Team). This gives us the actually allocated memory for each process without shared memory. 
* The Physical Memory Used is from "VmRSS" in "/proc/$pid/status"
* "CommitLimit" from "/proc/meminfo" as memory allocation limit. 
* "Committed_AS" from "/proc/meminfo" for global allocated memory across the system. 


## Diagram Generated
All the diagram generated have a red warning line to indicate where is the CommitLimit except per VM PythonVM measurement. 
* Allocated Memory per Process vs Total Allocated Memory(Commited_AS) vs Physical Memory Usage(RSS)
    * NSO Core(ncs.smp)
    * JavaVM
    * PythonVM
        * per VM (Without CommitLimit Warning Line to increase visibility)
        * Total for all the VMs
* Comparison between ncs.smp, JavaVM and PythonVM
    * Allocated Memory per Process vs Total Allocated Memory(Commited_AS) 
    * Total Allocated Memory(Commited_AS) vs Physical Memory Usage(RSS)

## Recommended CommitLimit
vm.overcommit_ratio can be calculated with the following formula
```
100(CommitLimit - SWAP) / (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) = vm.overcommit_ratio
```
After data collection, the code will list the maximum Commited_AS + Buffer and recommend that as CommitLimit

```

Recommended CommitLimit: 15929672.0
Please add some buffer range based on the Recommended CommitLimit
```

## Example Usage
Customer has configured the following settings to only allow 50 percent of total memory to get allocated in the system. 
```
# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
50
# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
2
```
While NSO require much more than that during the startup. In the diagram below we can clearly see Memory allocated has cross the CommitLimit which triggers a OOM Crash. 
![alt text](sample_diagram/ncs.smp/mem_ncs.smp.png "Memory Consumption for NSO Core")

The memory consumption diagram from ncs.smp shows the allocated memory has not significant spike during the time allocated memory spiked. This can show the issue is because some other process. For example a cron process launched something exactly at that time.
